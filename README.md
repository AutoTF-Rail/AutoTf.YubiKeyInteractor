# AutoTf.YubiKeyInteractor
This is the official YubiKey Interactor to register yubikeys on a central server, and validate them.


While the UI isn't being shipped, the code is valid for other use in e.g. the [AutoTF Manager](https://github.com/AutoTF-Rail/AutoTf.Manager)(Used for train and device management)
